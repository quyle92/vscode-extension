# Code Autocomplete &middot; [![Visual Studio Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/svipas.code-autocomplete.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svipas.code-autocomplete)

Unofficial [TabNine](https://www.tabnine.com) client (all-language autocomplete) for the VS Code.

**Difference between [official TabNine extension](https://github.com/codota/tabnine-vscode):**

- Updated `README` to contain as much documentation as possible.
- Added more VS Code settings and TabNine commands.
- Kept only `.` and `:` trigger characters.
- Removed restriction to show only 1 result if end of the word is `.` or `::`.
- Always shows correct suggestion detail for e.g. `41%` or `TabNine`.
- Won't preselect TabNine suggestions.
- De-prioritized TabNine suggestions to be at the end of the list whenever it's possible.
- Changed TabNine suggestions kind from `property` to `text` in order to avoid misunderstanding which suggestions are from TabNine.
- Triggers suggestion list if suggestion ends with `.` or `::`.
- Included postfix in suggestions for e.g. instead of `log(` it will show `log()`.
- Disabled suggestions in Git input (commit message), for VS Code JSON files like `settings.json`, etc.
- Starts TabNine process on VS Code startup.
- Automatically downloads latest TabNine binary on VS Code startup.
- Bundled extension for faster startup.
- For a full list of changes you can take a look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/svipas/vscode-code-autocomplete/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation

Install through VS Code extensions, search for `Code Autocomplete` by `Benas Svipas`. _If you can't find extension by name try to search by publisher name._

## Usage

After installing this extension latest TabNine binary is automatically downloaded. After TabNine binary is downloaded you can immediately start to use TabNine in VS Code, you don't need to do anything additionally. But if you want to improve experience with TabNine, continue to read below.

## Semantic completion

Semantic completion permits suggestions which make use of language-specific information via [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). In other words it improves suggestions.

If you want to enable semantic completion for specific language open file in text editor and [use command palette](#commands) or [type command in active file](#commands).

## Local vs Cloud

<details>
<summary><strong>Local</strong></summary>

TabNine Local uses your machine's CPU to run a deep learning model for providing completions. Your code stays on your machine.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cloud</strong></summary>

Enabling TabNine Cloud sends small parts of your code to our servers to provide GPU-accelerated completions. Other than for the purpose of fulfilling your query, your data isn't used, saved or logged in any way.
